            <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed
                in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
                languages such as JavaScript.<br>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
                storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page
                semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.<br>HTML elements are the
                building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms
                may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
                structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML
                elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.<br>Tags such as <img> and <input>
                        directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide
                            information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not
                            display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.<br>HTML can embed
                            programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
                            content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World
                            Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS
                            standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>
